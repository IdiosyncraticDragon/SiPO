> Guiying Li, Peng Yang, Chao Qian, Richang Hong, and Ke Tang: Stage-Wise Magnitude-Based Pruning for Recurrent Neural Networks. IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS), 2022. [Early access](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9808105)


## Introduction

This code is the implementation of the paper "Stage-wise Grouping for Recurrent Neural Networks Pruning". In this project, we will provide the download links for preprocessed data, original model and the pruned model. Then, we will provide scripts to run the pruned model to inspect the performance of pruning w.r.t to the number of connections pruned and the performance change on the dataset. Finally, we will provide a demonstration of how to prune the neural network models by the project, using the language model as example (The scripts for NMT pruning is also provided, but it need nearly a week to run the script, so that we do not suggest the user to run it for just a demonstration).

## Environment setup

### install by anaconda

1. Firstly, the user needs to install anaconda.
2. Then, check the `requirments.yaml` and `requirments.txt` in the project folder.
3. Install the python environment by:

```bash
$> conda env create -f requirements.yaml -n SiPO-env
$> conda activate SiPO-env
$> pip install -i  https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple -r requirements.txt
```

4. The environment is installed.

***OR***

you can run the `setup.sh`.



### build by docker

**To Be Finished.**

   [Baidu Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Z5H5SX64-aYHug3uho59CA)
   [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1imkA2Fq5OyMhOxlcbgpymScbxCGBL1hF?usp=sharing)

   [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RKpRbu_W7kCNK-qy1WeuUsEacLfXqRgx?usp=sharing)

**Note:** put the downloaded models into the folder `model` under this project. 



### Inspect the pruned models

**Note:** The pruning is implemented by setting the pruned connections' weight value to zero, so that the direct storage of the pruned models is the same as the original models. In this section, the user can use provided script to find out how many connections are pruned in the pruned model and check the performances of the pruned model on the dataset.

- Language models:

```bash
$> cd utils
$> chmod +x lm_run_scripts.sh
$> ./lm_run_scripts.sh
```

If the environment is set successfully, the data and models are download and placed to the `data` folder and `model` folder, the results will be:

```bash
$> ./lm_run_scripts.sh
========Language Model==========

```

**Explanation:**

The "========Language Model==========" is the results split bar, which indicate a evaluation for one model.

The first "========Language Model==========" indicates the evaluation of the original LM model. The following results indicate the evaluation of the pruned LM model.

- RNNSearch:

```bash
$> cd utils
$> chmod +x rnnsearch_run_scripts.sh
$> ./rnnsearch_run_scripts.sh
```

If the environment is set successfully, the data and models are download and placed to the `data` folder and `model` folder, the results will be:

```bash

## Experiments for Language model

Organized by the connection grouping strategies.

- **All-in-one Strategy**

  1. pruning without retraining:

  ```bash
  $> conda activate SiPO-env
  $> cd SiPO/src
  $> chmod +x run_lm_mp_exp1.sh
  $> ./run_lm_mp_exp1.sh
  ```

  When the running is finished

     - the running record is saved under  `SiPO/running_records/lm_simple_grid.txt`
     - the pruned models in each iteration can be found under the `__C.LM_MODEL_PATH` defined in `SiPO/src/config.py`

  2. iterative pruning and retraining:

  ```bash
  $> conda activate SiPO-env
  $> cd SiPO/src
  $> chmod +x run_lm_mp_exp2.sh
  $> ./run_lm_mp_exp2.sh
  ```

  When the running is finished

     - the running record is saved under  `SiPO/running_records/exp_lm_mp_iterative_log.txt`

     - the retrained models in each iteration can be found under the `__C.LM_MODEL_TMP_FOLDER` defined in `SiPO/src/config.py`

     - the pruned models in each iteration can be found under the `__C.LM_MODEL_PATH` defined in `SiPO/src/config.py`

       **Note:** The best model is the retrained one whose  accuracy can be recovered by retraining. For example, if the model can not be retrained to recover its accuracy in the 8-th iteration, then the best model is the retrained on in the 7-th iteration.

- **Layer-wise Strategy**

1. pruning without retraining:

```bash
$> conda activate SiPO-env
$> cd SiPO/src
$> chmod +x run_lm_lmp_exp1.sh
$> ./run_lm_lmp_exp1.sh
```

When the running is finished

   - the running record is saved under  `SiPO/running_records/lm_layer_grid.txt`
   - the pruned models in each iteration can be found under the `__C.LM_MODEL_PATH` defined in `SiPO/src/config.py`

2. iterative pruning and retraining:

```bash
$> conda activate SiPO-env
$> cd SiPO/src
$> chmod +x run_lm_lmp_exp2.sh
$> ./run_lm_lmp_exp2.sh
```

When the running is finished

   - the running record is saved under  `SiPO/running_records/exp_lm_lmp_iterative_log.txt`

   - the retrained models in each iteration can be found under the `__C.LM_MODEL_TMP_FOLDER` defined in `SiPO/src/config.py`

   - the pruned models in each iteration can be found under the `__C.LM_MODEL_PATH` defined in `SiPO/src/config.py`

     **Note:** The best model is the retrained one whose  accuracy can be recovered by retraining. For example, if the model can not be retrained to recover its accuracy in the 8-th iteration, then the best model is the retrained on in the 7-th iteration.

- **Stage-wise Strategy**

1. pruning without retraining:

```bash
$> conda activate SiPO-env
$> cd SiPO/src
$> chmod +x run_lm_sipo_exp1.sh
$> ./run_lm_sipo_exp1.sh
```

When the running is finished

   - the running record is saved under  `SiPO/running_records/lm_stage-wise_opt.txt`
   - the pruned models in each iteration can be found under the `__C.LM_MODEL_PATH` defined in `SiPO/src/config.py`

2. iterative pruning and retraining:

```bash
$> conda activate SiPO-env
$> cd SiPO/src
$> chmod +x run_lm_sipo_exp2.sh
$> ./run_lm_sipo_exp2.sh
```

When the running is finished

   - the running record is saved under  `SiPO/running_records/exp_lm_sipo_iterative_log.txt`
